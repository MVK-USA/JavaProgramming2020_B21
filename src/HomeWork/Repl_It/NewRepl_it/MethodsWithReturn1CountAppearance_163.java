Create a method that gets an array of strings and a string, the method returns an int.

It counts how many times a string appears in the array and returns the count.

for example (pseudo code):

some_array = ["a","foo","bar","foo","bla"]

some_string = "foo"

count_appearance(some_array ,some_string )

will return 2 because some_array  has 2 appearances of "foo" string.
